# Open AI Article Summarizer

## About The Project

This is a React-based web application that allows users to summarize articles using the OpenAI API. Users can simply paste the URL of an article into the input box, press enter, and the application will generate a summary of the article. The application also uses local storage to store all data, allowing users to browse their previous articles and URLs.
